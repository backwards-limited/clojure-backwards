# Setup

Apologies I shall only cover **Mac** - One day I may include Linux and Windows.

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for easy package management on Mac:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Install essentials:

```bash
brew install clojure/tools/clojure
```

and in future, to upgrade:

```bash
brew upgrade clojure/tools/clojure
```

To get started on the command line with a REPL:

```bash
clj
```

Optional installations:

```bash
brew install bat
```
