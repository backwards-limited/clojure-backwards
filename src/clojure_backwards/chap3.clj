; New version of strike

; The target entity can contain an :armor key, which contains a coefficient used to calculate the final amount of damage.
; The bigger the number, the better the armor.
; For example, an armor value of 0.8 for a strike of 100 points results in 20 damage points being inflicted.
; An armor value of 0.1 results in 90 damage points being inflicted,
; 0 means no armor,
; and 1 means invincible.

(defn strike
  ([target weapon]
   (let [points (weapon weapon-damage)]

       (update target :health + points)

; Now we would like to use our associative destructuring technique to retrieve the camp and armor values directly
; from the function parameters, and reduce the amount of code in the function's body.
; The only problem we have is that we still need to return an updated version of the target entity,
; but how could we both destructure the target entity and keep a reference of the target parameter?
; Clojure has your back â€“ you can use the special key :as to bind the destructured map to a specific name.
