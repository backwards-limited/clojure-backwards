; ELO

; A function implementing the formula for calculating the probability of a player defeating another player:
(defn match-probability
  [player-1-rating player-2-rating]
  (/ 1
     (+ 1
        (math/expt 10 (/ (- player-2-rating player-1-rating) 400)))))

(defn recalculate-rating [k-factor previous-rating expected-outcome real-outcome]
  (+ previous-rating (* k-factor (- real-outcome expected-outcome))))


; Player ratings:
; This is the most important part: a huge map linking each player to his rating.
; The map will be updated with the new ratings for the two players in the match being analyzed.

; Success count:
; For each match where one of the two players has a better than 50% chance of winning, did the expected winner actually win?
; By counting successes, you'll be able to divide by the total number of match predictions to determine the precision of your predictions.

; Total match count:
; The total number of matches that have been considered.

; Prediction count:
; The number of matches where a winner could be predicted â€“ that is, matches where the forecast was not 50-50.
; Since we're excluding those matches from the success count, we need to exclude them from the prediction count.
